         Xiaoqi was bought by me from a cafe owner when it was three months old. At the cafe, the first time I saw Xiao Qi, it kept calling at me through the glass. At the time I thought it was destined to be my cat, so I took it home. Due to poor health since childhood, Xiao Qi has always been thin. I have carefully fed it for many years, and now it has gained weight. I also hope that it will always be healthy in the future.
